        <p class ="para1 border">Here at Balloon co. You can set up a beautiful day with friends, family, or that special someone in your life, just soaring through the clouds in the most peaceful way possible. Many people choose to have picnics while in the hot air balloon. There are several options available. Our reccomended choice for first timers is to have a course where you are strapped to the ground, and taught how to properly use the hot air balloon. Our second option is to be thethered to a winch. When you enter the balloon we will give you a certain amount of space, and once your allotted time has been reached (If you chose a time limit) we will drag you back down safely. Our final choice is to have full control of the hot air balloon with no tether. This is only for experienced flyers, or the ones that have been through our course. We hope to see you soon!
