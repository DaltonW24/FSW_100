                <p>Here at IEC we strive to provide the best image editing in the business. We have all had moment where we take pictures of moments that we want to remember, but when we see those pictures years later, we're not sure exactly what we're looking at, or we look a lot worse than we remembered. There are so many small things that can ruin a photo that you wouldn't even think of in the moment. One of our most popular request is to whiten teeth in people's smiles, and to cut stray people out of the background. Another popular request is to remove the glare on certain objects. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>As stated above, One of our most popular request is to whiten the clients teeth to make their smile look better</li>
